# Basic Neural Network
## Introduction
I assume the reader to have a basic knowledge about neural networks. I will 
just explain how to build one with tensorflow. I will not explain what a 
neural network is.

Loops over namescopes, play around

## Building neural net
## Visual debugging - Give example.
##Knoten über namen finden - Advanced Namescoping
## Save Restore
## Mystery Layer
## Partially connected layer
